import { NavLink } from "react-router-dom";

/*
NavLink:
- React Router's version of <a>, used for navigation without page reloads.
- Automatically applies "active" styling when its `to` matches the current URL.

About `end`:
- Optional prop that enforces exact matching when you're linking to parent paths.
- Without `end`, a NavLink to "/settings" will ALSO be active on visting "/settings/profile".
- With `end`, it only matches exactly "/settings" â€” and nothing beyond.

<NavLink to="/"> is an exceptional case because every URL matches /. To avoid this matching every single route by default, it effectively ignores the end prop and only matches when you're at the root route.

Summary:
- You probably don't need `end` for root-level routes like "/".
- You DO need it for routes that are parents of other nested routes.
